## 🔮 Future Plans

### More Quizzes
* The goal is to add more quizzes eventually, building a large database of ways for users to brush up on their Jewish knowledge.

### More Features
* I'm considering adding features like having an account and keeping track of any user's statistics
  * The point would be to post the fastest time solved for each quiz, like a video game, with the top 5 scores making the leaderboard
    * A tiebreaker may be decided by which user named more correct answers in order.
  * Another option may be to inform a user when they've beaten their own personal best.
  * To be clear, in adding this feature, I have no intention of tracking any user's data of any sort. I am solely interested in adding more functionality to the game.
